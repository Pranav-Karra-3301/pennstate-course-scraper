A high-performance course scraper for Penn State's LionPath system that extracts comprehensive course information including enrollment data, schedules, descriptions, and more.

## Features

- **Complete Course Data**: Scrapes all available course information including:
  - Course codes, titles, and descriptions
  - Enrollment capacity and availability
  - Class schedules and locations
  - Instructor information
  - Prerequisites and requirements
  - Class attributes and General Education categories

- **High Performance**: 
  - Aggressive parallelization with configurable worker pools
  - Rate limiting to avoid overwhelming servers
  - Session pooling for optimal connection reuse
  - Fast regex-based parsing where possible

- **University Park Focus**: 
  - Filters for University Park courses by default
  - Identifies and excludes World Campus and branch campus courses
  - Supports all campuses if needed

- **Multiple Output Formats**: 
  - JSONL (default, efficient for large datasets)
  - JSON (pretty formatted)
  - CSV (for spreadsheet analysis)

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/psu-course-scraper.git
cd psu-course-scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Testing

```bash
# Test optimized scraper (recommended)
python test_optimized_scraper.py

# Test original scraper
python test_scraper.py

# Manual test with 5 subjects
python scraper_optimized.py --max-subjects 5 --debug
```

### Basic Usage

#### Optimized Scraper (Recommended)

```bash
# Scrape all University Park courses with optimized data structure
python scraper_optimized.py

# Custom settings with optimized scraper
python scraper_optimized.py --output courses.jsonl --max-workers 16 --max-detail-workers 50 --rate-limit 20

# Test mode
python scraper_optimized.py --max-subjects 10 --debug
```

#### Original Scraper (Legacy)

```bash
# Original scraper (larger file sizes, flat structure)
python scraper.py --output courses_flat.jsonl --max-workers 16 --rate-limit 15
```

### Command Line Options

```
--output, -o          Output file (default: psu_courses_enhanced.jsonl)
--format              Output format: jsonl, json, csv (default: jsonl)
--campus, -c          Campus filter: UP, ALL (default: UP)
--max-workers         Subject scraping workers (default: 16)
--max-detail-workers  Course detail workers (default: 50)
--rate-limit          Requests per second (default: 20)
--delay               Delay between requests (default: 0.2s)
--max-subjects        Limit subjects for testing
--retry-attempts      Retry attempts (default: 2)
--debug               Enable debug logging
```

## Performance

- **Typical Performance**: 15-25 courses per second
- **Full University Park Scrape**: ~9,000 courses in 6-10 minutes
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB for full dataset
- **Network**: Respectful rate limiting (20 req/sec default)

## Data Structure

### Optimized Format (Default)

The scraper uses an optimized data structure that separates course-level information from section-specific details, reducing redundancy and file size:

```json
{
  "course": {
    "course_code": "CMPSC 121",
    "course_title": "Introduction to Programming Techniques",
    "subject": "CMPSC",
    "catalog_number": "121",
    "units": "4.0",
    "course_description": "Basic programming concepts...",
    "enrollment_requirements": "Prerequisites...",
    "class_attributes": ["GenEd: GQ"],
    "academic_organization": "Computer Science and Engineering"
  },
  "sections": [
    {
      "section": "001",
      "class_number": "12345",
      "instructor": "Smith, John",
      "days": "MoWeFr",
      "times": "10:10AM - 11:00AM",
      "campus": "UP",
      "room": "IST 110",
      "class_capacity": 150,
      "enrollment_total": 142,
      "available_seats": 8,
      "status": "Open"
    },
    {
      "section": "002",
      "class_number": "12346",
      "instructor": "Johnson, Mary",
      "days": "TuTh",
      "times": "1:25PM - 2:40PM",
      "campus": "UP",
      "room": "IST 210",
      "class_capacity": 150,
      "enrollment_total": 138,
      "available_seats": 12,
      "status": "Open"
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "total_capacity": 300,
    "total_enrollment": 280,
    "available_seats": 20,
    "section_count": 2,
    "campuses": ["UP"]
  }
}
```

### Benefits of Optimized Structure

- **50-70% smaller file sizes** by eliminating redundant course information
- **Easier analysis** of courses with multiple sections
- **Built-in statistics** for capacity and enrollment aggregation
- **Logical separation** of course vs. section data
